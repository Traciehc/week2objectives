This is the readme file for week2objectives.
This repo was set up in GitHub.
I have cloned it to my local directory using gitbash.
I will do an add to add this readme file and I will do a commit. *That did not work so I ended up adding the readme in github and the commit also.

Lastly I will do a git push to origin and start a pull request.
I am using only gitbash and the command line to accomplish these tasks.
Wish me luck.
